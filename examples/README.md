All those examples are copies of the ones in ctrulib, and contain a CMakeLists.txt that illustrates how to use the 3ds-cmake repository scripts.
Please refer to this repository's README.md for more information on how to build projects using these scripts.

* hello_world gives you the very minimal CMakeLists.txt for a project using ctrulib
* simple_tri has a CMakeLists.txt showing how to use shaders with picasso
* textured_cube has a CMakeLists.txt showing how to use shaders and embed binary files into your application
